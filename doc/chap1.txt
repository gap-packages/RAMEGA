  [33X[0;0Y[5XThelma[105X  stands  for  ``THreshold ELements, Modelling and Applications". This
  package is dedicated to realization of Boolean functions by the means of the
  threshold  elements  and  multilayered  perceptrons. Threshold elements were
  introduced  in  [MP43].  A  certain  number  of  articles on threshold logic
  appeared  in  60-s  and 70-s, however this field is regaining a considerable
  interest nowadays as well (see [EBT16],[Hor94], [GVKB11], [NJSS16], e.t.c).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  mostly  refer to the methods proposed in [ABGG80], [GPR83], [GMB17], and
  [Der65].[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YOverview over this manual[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YChapter  [14X2[114X  describes  the  functions operating with the threshold elements.
  They   include   the   basic  operations,  the  functions  that  verify  the
  realizability of a given Boolean function by a single threshold element, and
  some  iterative  methods.  Chapter  [14X3[114X  describes  the  functions  for neural
  networks, built from the threshold elements.[133X
